NGO Site with Payment Form and Contact Form
This repository contains the source code for an NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) website built using Next.js. The website includes a payment form and a contact form, aiming to provide information about the NGO's mission, projects, and ways to support their cause.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


Payment Form
The website includes a payment form that allows users to make donations securely. The form is integrated with a payment gateway API, enabling seamless online transactions. Users can enter their payment details, select the donation amount, and submit the form to complete the transaction.

Contact Form
To get in touch with the NGO, users can fill out the contact form provided on the website. The contact form collects information such as name, email address, and message. Once submitted, the NGO's team will receive the contact information and respond to the inquiry accordingly.
## Getting Started

Configuration
The configuration settings for the NGO site can be found in the .env file. Before running the application, make sure to update the necessary environment variables, such as the database connection details and API keys for the payment gateway integration.
